## Setup a Vector Database locally
This repository performs the setup of the Vector database locally to store Vectors and perform vector similarity search in python.

To setup, 
- Setup Local Environment and activate, I used:

```
python3 -m venv env
./env/Scripts/activate
```

- Install requirements,

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Run all the cells under `VectorDB.ipynb` and follow the instructions of notebook setup.


**This is just to demo how easily you can setup your Vector database locally**
